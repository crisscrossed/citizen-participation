Hyperlocal citizen participation
=====================

Hyperlocal website for citizen participation and open data. This rails app has all essential features needed to run a citizen participation project. Next to citizen initiatives different data streams can be included, which are all represented on a map. This website was possibly to the great contribution from the "[Aachener Stiftung Kathy Beys](http://www.aachener-stiftung.de/)".

Other features:
- Citizen initiatives with subscription and supporter feature
- District pages with information overview
- Search result subscription by email
- Profile pages
- Location-based information
